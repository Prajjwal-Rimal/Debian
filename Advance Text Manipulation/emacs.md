## Emacs

1. Emacs is a very powerful editor to open we use the following command:

	```bash 
	emacs # to open emacs
	```
2. higher learning curve than vim but extremely extensible, slower as well
3. buffer:

	- in Emacs is what our text resides in
	- when we open a file the files contents are stored in a buffer
	- we can open multiple buffers and switch between them

4. C- control key = ctrl (C)
5. M- meta key = alt key (M)
6. save commands:
```
 C-x + C-s # Save a file
 C-x + C-w # Save file as
 C-x + s # Save all
```
7. open file:
```
C-x + C-f
```

8. switching between buffers
```
C-x + b # switch buffer
C-x + right arrow # right cycle 
C-x + left arrow # left cycle 
```

9. close the buffer
```
C-x + k
```

10. split the current buffer
```
C-x + 2
C-x + o # switch between this type of buffer
```

11. set buffer as the current screen
```
C-x + 1 
```

12. text navigation
```
C-up + arrow # up one paragraph
C-down + arrow # down one paragraph
C-left + arrow # one word left
C-right + arrow # one word right
M - > # end of the buffer
M - < # beginning of the buffer
```

13. select text
```
C + space key # ctrl + space
```

14. cut text
```
C + w # cut
```

15. paste text
```
C + y # paste
```

16. undo text 
```
C - / # most common undo
C-x + u # undo text
```

17. exiting emacs
```
C-x + C-c # quit without saving 
```
