## Package Dependencies 
1. packages do not just work by themselves they need additional dependencies 
2. in linux dependencies refer to other packages or shared libraries, basically a series of code a program is going to reuse and doesn't have to be written into the program
3. packages need dependencies to help them run 
4. without dependencies packages are basically useless, programs will crash, fail to start, will behave incorrectly
5. When a game says install DirectX 11, thatâ€™s because DirectX 11 is a dependency for the game.
